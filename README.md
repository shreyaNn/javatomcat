# java-tomcat-maven-example

This is an example ready-to-deploy java web application built for Tomcat using Maven and webapp-runner.

## Running Locally

(need maven and java installed)

```
mvn package
java -jar target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar target/*.war
```

The application will be available on `http://localhost:8080`.

## How This Was Built

1. Generate the project using a Maven archetype:

   ```
   mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp
   ```

2. Add the webapp-runner plugin into the `pom.xml`:

   ```
   <build>
     <!-- ... -->
     <plugins>
       <!-- ... -->
       <plugin>
         <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
         <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
         <version>2.3</version>
         <executions>
           <execution>
             <phase>package</phase>
             <goals><goal>copy</goal></goals>
             <configuration>
               <artifactItems>
                 <artifactItem>
                   <groupId>com.github.jsimone</groupId>
                   <artifactId>webapp-runner</artifactId>
                   <version>8.5.11.3</version>
                   <destFileName>webapp-runner.jar</destFileName>
                 </artifactItem>
               </artifactItems>
             </configuration>
           </execution>
         </executions>
       </plugin>
     </plugins>
   </build>

# Run Spring Boot in Tomcat

This repository shows how to create a WAR file from a Spring Boot 2.4 project for deployment in Tomcat.  Please read [Deploy a Spring Boot Application into Tomcat](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/04/16/spring-boot-tomcat) to see how this example was created.

**Prerequisites:** [Java 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.

## Getting Started

To install this example, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-tomcat-example.git
cd okta-spring-boot-tomcat-example
```

To run this example, you'll need to create an account and OIDC app on Okta.

### Create an Application in Okta

Before you begin, youâ€™ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com/) and run `okta register` to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run `okta login`.

Then, run `okta apps create`. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit. Choose **Web** and press **Enter**.

Select **Okta Spring Boot Starter**. Change the Redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta,http://localhost:8080/demo/login/oauth2/code/okta` and the Logout Redirect to `http://localhost:8080/,http://localhost:8080/demo`.

After modifying this file, start the example and you should be able to authenticate with Okta at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Packaging

To package the project (and create the WAR) run the following:

```bash
./mvnw package
```

The WAR file will be created in the `target` directory. Upload `demo.war` to Tomcat and you'll be able to log in at `http://localhost:8080/demo`.
